Summary: 
The game is meant to be a casual, yet competitive game between friends. We want the players to have fun, smile, and laugh while playing this.
We wanted the players to feel a competitive nature, yet competitive in a way where it doesn't seem like the player is fighting against the other player. Each player has control of their own cat and collect various powerups to help them stay alive. The first player to die loses. 
There is little way to indirectly attack each other, and this is so that the feeling of friends playing is stronger than the competitive nature. It's mainly about 2 friends playing a game and surviving as long as they can, and the first to die will lose, and this will mainly be on their own skill, tho stealing powerups and having certain powerups affect the other player will add more competitiveness.
Info on how to play the game is found in-game.
