The game is meant to be a casual game and is not meant to be stressful at all. We want the players to have fun, smile, and laugh while playing this.
Although there are competitive elements in this game and players can indirectly damage the other player, we didn't want the game to be so competitive that it causes people to rage (e.g. blue shell in mario karts.)
